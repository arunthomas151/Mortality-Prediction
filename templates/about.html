              <br>  <h1>MORTALITY PREDICTION</h1>
        <p>Mortality prediction in the Intensive Care Unit(ICU) is considered as one of critical steps for treatment of patients in serious condition.
           It is a big challenge it model time-series variable for mortality prediction in ICU, because physiological variables usch as breadth rate and blood pressure are sampled with in consistant time frequencies.
           In addition, it is difficult to capture the timing changes of clinical data and to interpret the prediction result of ICU mortality.
           o deal with these challenges ,in this paper we propose a novel ICU mortality Prediction Algorithm combining LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) model with supervised learning.

        <h3 style="color: white">Testing Module</h3>
        <p>We proposes 37 time-serie variables related to patients signs.</p>
        <h3 style="color: white">Training Module</h3>
        <p>We turn and evaluate our model using a real-world data set containing 4000 ICU patients experiments results show that our proposed method can significantly out perform many baseline methods.</p>

       <p>We construct the bidirectional LSTM model with supervision technical to quality reflect significant changes in patientâ€™s sign.</p>
